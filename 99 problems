/*You will write a program that asks a user how many problems they have
* -
*In your prompt
*instruct them to enter a number between 3 and 99.
*(Check to make sure they comply.)
*You will then print a line for each of their problems finishing off with a line saying they
*have no problems.
*You will then ask
*if they have any more problems to start the process again.
*Finish your program with a pleasant output line to let the user know he/she is done.
