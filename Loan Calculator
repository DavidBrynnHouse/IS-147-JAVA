/*In addition to the instructions in the book also use a Do-While loop 
for asking if the user wants to do another set of amounts.
Also add % and $ formatting to output columns.
Write a pro-
gram that lets the user enter the loan amount and loan period in number of years
and displays the monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from
5% to 8%, with an increment of 1/8
